## Ryan Curvey'a Portfolio

* This project was created as a placeto showcase my completed applications for potential employers to access when I am interviewing for a a career in web development.

* Currently there are no completed projects linked to the main images in the body, but some of my interests are acting as a place holder for the upcoming project that will be replacign those links & images.

* I wanted to create this portfolio not only to showcase the quality of my work but also allow potential employers to dig into the code that I have written. Beyond the written code, this will allow employers to determine whether my skill set algns with the skillset that they are hiring for at their company.

* By creating this project I learned the many facets and powers of CSS. On the flipside I also learned how tricky it can be to control and delvier the predicted/desired outcomes.

* This portfolio allows a viewer to easily navigate from the top nav bar to my external Linkedin page, as well as the About Me, Work, and Contact Me section within the page. All of the images (placeholding for future projects) link out to respective pages if you are intersted in learning more about my interests. On the footer nav bar a viewer can access my telephone number, my email address, my GitHub page, my Twitter account, as well as a link to Spotify.

* That page can be found at this address: https://ryancurvey.github.io/portfolio/

* Here is a Screenshot of the completed page:
